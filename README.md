## General info
Every city has municipal services to address dangerous conditions on streets and highways. A resident must call the city to report these issues, creating  a one-to-one interaction between the city and a resident. As such, other residents have no visibility into whether other residents have already reported an issue. 

We created 311Now to ease the process of reporting and provide residents in the community a platform to highlight and discuss issues in their community.
